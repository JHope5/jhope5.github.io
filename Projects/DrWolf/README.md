## Dr. Wolf's Cyber Experiment
A game that allows the user to edit the map code to solve the level and progress in the game. 
Edit the white lines, and press the 'Execute Code' button at the top of the page to see what
you've changed. If you want to get the original level code back, just press the 'Reset Level'
button. Once you're ready to complete the level, click on the game on the right hand side of
the page and use the arrow keys, or the W A S D keys to move the 'P' towards the 'O'.
